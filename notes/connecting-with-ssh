To connect to the Linux server, which resides at merlin.me.jhu.edu, see the
appropriate instructions below.

========
PC USERS
========

- Install PuTTY (http://www.putty.org/)
- Install Xming (http://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/)

- In PuTTY: use hostname merlin.me.jhu.edu
- Enable X11 Forwarding:
  - In the menu, under Connection, select SSH and then X11
  - Check the box for `Enable X11 Forwarding'
- Click Open to log in
- Enter your JHED ID and password
- If it gives you a Security Alert, click Yes because I promise my server
  will not try to hack your computer
* If you still receive an error message involving failure to connect to
  the X server when trying to run code, try running the XLaunch program that
  came with Xming

=========
MAC USERS
=========

- In a terminal, type `ssh -X <JHED ID>@merlin.me.jhu.edu'
- If you find that X11 Forwarding does not work (if you see some error when
  trying to display a plot, for example), install XQuartz
  (http://www.xquartz.org/) and try again
